Make sure python is running on version 3.8


Step 1 : open cmd in the same folder where the files are

Step 2 : run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

once all the requirements are installed, we proceed with running the server and client scripts.

Step 3: open cmd in the same folder where the files are

Step 4: run "python server.py"

this runs the server script and makes sure that the server is running at the port mentioned.(in this case the port is 8080)

Step 5: open 3 other(more or less depending on the number of minimum clients you have mentioned in the server.py file) instances of cmd 

Step 6: run "python client.py" in all the instances of cmd

Once all the instances are running the code, the final result is tabulated at the server.py instance of cmd. The result of each round and the final result are all displayed in the server.py instance.
